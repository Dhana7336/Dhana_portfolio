        `With a strong foundation in full-stack development and data engineering, I build intelligent, scalable systems that merge software engineering with AI/ML technologies. I specialize in designing intuitive front-end experiences, architecting robust back-end services, and building data pipelines that enable real-time insights, automation, and seamless product scalability. My work focuses on performance, maintainability, and user-centric design turning complex problems into reliable, production-ready solutions.
        
        I‚Äôm currently focused on developing next-generation AI-driven applications, integrating LLM, RAG frameworks, conversational AI to power chatbots and domain-specific systems. Leveraging tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and cloud platforms including AWS, Azure,  GCP, I create scalable, secure, and resilient architectures. I‚Äôm passionate about bridging cloud-native systems, data workflows, and AI/ML models to deliver impactful, intelligent products that accelerate innovation and business growth.`,
